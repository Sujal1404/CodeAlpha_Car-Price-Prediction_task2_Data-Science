# CodeAlpha_Car-Price-Prediction_task2_Data-Science
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the selling price of used cars based on key features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage and engine specifications. The goal is to build a reliable, data-driven model that helps users, dealerships, or marketplaces estimate a fair market value for a car.
