# CodeAlpha_Car-Price-Prediction_task2_Data-Science
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the selling price of used cars based on key features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage and engine specifications. The goal is to build a reliable, data-driven model that helps users, dealerships, or marketplaces estimate a fair market value for a car.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, remove outliers, and scale numerical features. Multiple regression models are trained and compared (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.). The best-performing model is selected based on metrics like R² Score, RMSE, and MAE.
